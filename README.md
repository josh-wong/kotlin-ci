# Kotlinize your CI

This project is a sample of the various ways
I introduced Kotlin in our Android CI at Mercari.

This was used in:
+ a DroidKaigi prensentation (TODO: link)
+ a Mercari blog-post (TODO: link)

## Features

+ Custom docker images
+ JavaExec tasks in a composite build (see [./scripts](./scripts))
+ Kotlin script
